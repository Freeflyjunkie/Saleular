        Our Story
    </h2>
    <p>
        Saleular.com started with an idea to keep broken and used iPhones out of landfills. When the founders much-used, much-loved iPhone broke, it dawned on him that there weren't many eco-friendly or economically gainful things do with it. After some research, they discovered that there were a lot of people out there who had the same problem; broken iPhones, few options.

        Saleular.com offers an easier, faster, and higher paying option than Gazelle, iSellMyiPhone, BuyBackBoss or any other sites out there, guaranteed.
